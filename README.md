A scalable, real-time trading analytics platform that processes and visualizes market data for immediate insights and pattern recognition.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a comprehensive trading analytics solution using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) on AWS infrastructure. The platform enables automated ingestion of trading logs, real-time processing, and interactive visualization through custom dashboards, allowing traders to monitor market trends and identify trading patterns as they emerge.


### 🔄 Data Pipeline Flow

1. Trading logs are uploaded to Amazon S3
2. S3 event triggers SQS notifications
3. Filebeat picks up notifications and ships logs
4. Logstash processes and normalizes trade data
5. Elasticsearch indexes data for quick analysis
6. Kibana provides real-time dashboards and visualizations

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Analyze trading data as it arrives
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles increasing data volumes with AWS auto-scaling
- **Custom Dashboards**: Pre-built Kibana visualizations for common trading metrics
- **Historical Analysis**: Query and compare against historical trading patterns
- **Alerting**: Set up notifications for specific market conditions
- **Security**: Full ELK security implementation with authentication and encryption

## 🔧 Automation Highlights

- Automated EC2 instance configuration with user data scripts
- Python-based trade data simulator for testing and development
- Automated ELK security setup with certificates and authentication
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Automated EC2 instance scaling based on load

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
