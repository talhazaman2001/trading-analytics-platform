I've built a scalable trading analytics platform using AWS and the 𝗘𝗟𝗞 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 (𝗘𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵, 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗵, 𝗞𝗶𝗯𝗮𝗻𝗮) to process and visualise real-time trading data.

The architecture enables automated ingestion of trading logs, real-time processing, and interactive visualisation through custom dashboards. This allows traders to monitor market trends and identify trading patterns as they emerge.
